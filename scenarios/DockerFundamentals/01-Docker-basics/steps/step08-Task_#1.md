At this point we have our docker container **but** since we did not started the server within the docker file we will have to start it manually.

- You will have to find out the right commands in order to proceed to the next step or you will not be able to follow the rest of the practice.

1. Add a missing line to the `Dockerfile` to "open" the required port
2. The container should be rebuild with the updated code
3. Executed in detached mode so it will continue to run in the background
4. You need to start the server & expose the required **ports** so you can test your server
5. Test the server by clicking on the `node Server` tab.
