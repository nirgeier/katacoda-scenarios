- **You don't need to know NodeJs in order to be able to build the server**

- First of all we need nodejs in order to "develop" our server so lets install nodejs in our playground

    `apt-get update`{{execute}}

    `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x |  bash -`{{execute}}
    
    `apt-get install -y nodejs`{{execute}}


- Lets check if nodeJs is installed 

    `node --version`{{execute}}
